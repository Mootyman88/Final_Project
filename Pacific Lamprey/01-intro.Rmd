# Database Creation

All the adult lamprey that were used for this study received a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag, lengths and weight were taken, genetic clips from the dorsal fins were taken, capture and release site was recorded. A data base using RStudio and SQLite was used to organize the data.

## 2.1 Package upload and code for building database

The DBI and RSQLite package in RStudio needs to be uploaded in order to connect to SQLite.

```         
#install packages "DBI" and "RSQLite"
install.packages("DBI")
install.packages("RSQLite")

#Open DBI and RSQLite library
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)

#Connecting to my "Final.db" data base
Final_db <- dbConnect (RSQLite::SQLite(), "Final.db")
```

## Creating Lamprey Table

The Lamprey table contains: Lamprey ID, Capture Site, Release Site, Genetic, and PIT Tag #.

Create table in SQLite

```         
CREATE TABLE Lamprey (
    [Lamprey ID]   TEXT    PRIMARY KEY
                           NOT NULL,
    [Capture Site] TEXT    NOT NULL
                           REFERENCES Captures ([Capture Site]),
    [Release Site] TEXT    NOT NULL,
    Genetic        INTEGER,
    [PIT Tags #]   TEXT    REFERENCES Lamprey ([PIT Tags #]) 
);
```
